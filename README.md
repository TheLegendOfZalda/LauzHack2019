# LauzHack2019


These libraries should be installed in advance:
- numpy
- nltk
- gensim
- streamlit
- PyPDF2
- googlesearch
- mechanize

We also implement the 'GoogleNews-vector' word2vec language model, and the bin file could be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit). 

Then we can run the 'LauzHack_streamlit.py' in the terminal to see the demo web viewer.
